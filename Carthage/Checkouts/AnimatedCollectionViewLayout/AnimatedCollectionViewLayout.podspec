  s.description      = <<-DESC
  A normal UICollectionView has no transition effects when you scroll from one
  item to another. There are lots of ways to write animations for
  UICollectionView, but using a UICollectionViewLayout subclass is by far the
  simplest one. And it doesn't break any of your existing code. You can still
  use your UICollectionView subclass and you don't need to change your
  UICollectionViewCell. Just plug and enjoy.
